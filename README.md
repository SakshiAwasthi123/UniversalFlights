Universal Flights is a conceptual flight booking platform aiming to deliver a seamless user journey from flight selection to booking confirmation. The focus of this project is on designing the Booking Flights UI only — no backend or database functionality is included.

My Role: UI Designer
I was responsible for designing and implementing the following parts of the user interface:

Departure & Return Flights Selection

Display of available flights with filters, sorting, and pricing info

Passenger Booking Form

Input for passenger details (name, age, nationality, etc.)

Contact Information Form

Contact details like phone number, email, emergency contact

Extras & Add-ons Section

Extra luggage, insurance, meals, seat selection, etc.

Services & Preferences

Special assistance, travel class preferences, etc.

Booking Summary & Confirmation

Overview of booking before final submission

This project is entirely front-end focused — designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate layout, interaction, and responsiveness.
